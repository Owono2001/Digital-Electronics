# Digital-Electronics
For the Digital Electronics module, our group worked on designing and implementing a Digital Timer Circuit. The objective was to create a timer system capable of displaying time in four different formats: 30 minutes, 25 minutes, 20 minutes, and 15 minutes, using individual circuits integrated with a 2-bit control unit to select the required timing. The system used counters, flip-flops, logic gates, and seven-segment displays to track time accurately.

Key Components:
Pedro’s Circuit Design: Pedro developed a 25-minute timer using D Flip-Flops, NAND, NOR, and NOT gates. The system was designed to count up to 25 minutes and reset, with seconds and minutes tracked separately.
Mehraz’s Circuit: Mehraz created a 20-minute timer circuit using JK Flip-Flops and AND gates, integrating a display decoder to show time.
Helal’s Circuit: Helal designed a 30-minute timer, focusing on accuracy and stability using JK Flip-Flops and seven-segment displays.
Abdullah’s Circuit: Abdullah developed a 15-minute timer using asynchronous JK Flip-Flops and logic gates.
The four individual circuits were integrated using a multiplexer (MUX) control unit, which allowed the system to select and display time from the appropriate timer based on the user’s input. The output was displayed on a seven-segment display through a BCD to seven-segment decoder. The final circuit was simulated, and results were validated, ensuring proper time tracking for each timer format.
